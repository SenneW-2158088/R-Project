# - A server available? Jobs are equally likely to be processed by any of them
# - No server available? Job enters queue, leaves system after
#   6 min of waiting (if not started)
# - Server runs from 8:00 to 18:00 (10 hours)

# a: The expected waiting time for a randomly selected job;
# b: the expected response time;
# d: the expected length of a queue (excluding the jobs receiving service),
#    when a new job arrives;
# f: the probability that at least one server is available, when a job arrives;
# h: the expected number of jobs processed by each server;
# j: the expected number of jobs still remaining in the system at 6:03 pm;
